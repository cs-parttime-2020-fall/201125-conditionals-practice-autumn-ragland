# 20 11 25 Conditionals Practice
Completed exercises 1 - 4 in order, each exercises builds on the last. Add comments above each exercise solution (at minimum). When grading this assignment I will only run code that is not commented out. If you have partially functioning code comment it out and provide some context of what wasn't working so I can provide feedback.

## Set Up
1. Create an html file with an `h1` rendering the assignment title
1. Create a JS file 
1. Link the JS file before the closing `body` tag using the `script` tag
1. Open the HTML file in the browser

## Exercise 1
Prompt for the user for their name, role (owner, admin, contributor), and rank (1, 2, 3, or 4) and save the responses. Output the responses in a formatted string in the console.

## Exercise 2
If the user is an owner alert the message. "You are the owner!". If the first statement is false but the user is and admin alert the message "You are and admin!". If the first two statements are false but the user is a contributor alert the message "You are a contributor" Otherwise alert the message "You did not enter a valid role"

## Exercise 3
If the user is an owner and their rank is 2 or less alert the message "You have full read and write access". Otherwise alert the message "Your rank and role are not high enough for full read and write access".

## Exercise 4
If the user is an owner or admin or they have a rank of 1 alert the message "You have full read access". Otherwise alert the message "You need permission for certain actions".
